1. What's Jetpack Compose?  
    - Jetpack Compose is a modern toolkit for building Android UIs. Compose simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin capabilities.

2. What's annotations and why use it in compose?  
    -  Annotations are means of attaching extra information to code. This information helps tools like the Jetpack Compose compiler, and other developers understand the app's code.

3. What's the function of the annotation @Composable?   
    - All composable functions must have this annotation. This annotation informs the Compose compiler that this function is intended to convert data into UI. As a reminder, a compiler is a special program that takes the code you wrote, looks at it line by line, and translates it into something the computer can understand (machine language).
