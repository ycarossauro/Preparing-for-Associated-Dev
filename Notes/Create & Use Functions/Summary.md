# Summary

- Functions are defined with the `fun` keyword and contain reusable pieces of code.  
- Functions help make larger programs easier to maintain and prevent the unnecessary repetition of code.  
- Functions can return a value that you can store in a variable for later use.  
- Functions can take **parameters**, which are variables available inside a function body.  
- **Arguments** are the values that you pass in when you call a function.  
- You can name arguments when you call a function. When you use named arguments, you can reorder the arguments without affecting the output.  
- You can specify a **default argument** that lets you omit the argument when you call a function.
