# Notes about kotlin:

1. What's Kotlin?   
 Kotlin is a modern programming language that helps developers be more productive. For example, Kotlin allows you to be more concise and write fewer lines of code for the same functionality compared to other programming languages.

2. What makes kotlin so popular?    
    Apps that are built with Kotlin are also less likely to crash, resulting in a more stable and robust app for users. Essentially, with Kotlin, you can write better Android apps in a shorter amount of time. As a result, Kotlin is gaining momentum in the industry and is the language that the majority of professional Android developers use.

3. How does the computer understand the syntax of kotlin?   
    It understand because we use something called Kotlin Compiler, which takes the kotlin code you wrote, looks at it line by line, and translates it into something that the computer can understand. This process is called **compiling**.

4. Where the kotlin program starts running?     
    It start from the main function

5. Could you speak about relevant style guide recommendations in Kotlin?
    - Function names should be in camel case and should be verbs or verb phrases.
    - Each statement should be on its own line.
    - The opening curly brace should appear at the end of the line where the function begins.
    - There should be a space before the opening curly brace
    - The function body should be indented in by 4 spaces. Do not use a tab character to indent your code, type in 4 spaces.
    - The closing curly brace is on its own line after the last line of code in the function body. The closing brace should line up with the fun keyword at the beginning of the function.

7. What's troubleshooting in code?  
    Troubleshooting in code means finding and fixing errors in a program. It involves checking error messages, testing different solutions, and making sure the code works correctly.
